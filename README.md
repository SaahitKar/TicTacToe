# TicTacToe

This program simulates a game of tic-tac-toe with a randomized computer player, a smart computer player, or two different players. At every turn, the current board is printed out. Every turn, a person enters what location the desired letter is to be entered. When either a row, column, or diagonal is all the same one letter, the program outputs that a player has won and terminates the program.
